There is only  pac list now
===========================

The most important line:

.. code:: javascript

    var proxy = "SOCKS 192.168.99.202:1080; PROXY 192.168.99.202:1086";


Pac file has three types of proxy ways.

1. **"SOCKS ip:port;"**  use socks protocol
#. **"PROXY ip:prot;"**  use http protocol
#. **"DIRECT;"** means view urls directly
