There is only  pac list now
===========================

The most important line:

.. code:: javascript

    var proxy = "SOCKS 192.168.99.202:1080; PROXY 192.168.99.202:1086";


Pac file has three types of proxy ways.
1. `"SOCKS ip:port;"`  use socks protocol
2. `"PROXY ip:prot;"`  use http protocol
3. `"DIRECT;"` means view urls directly
